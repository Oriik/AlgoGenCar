# AlgoGenCar

My second genetic algorithm
Generate randomly a first generation of car then use genetic algorithm principle until we reach the last generation.
A new generation is create when all cars reach the end or didnt improve their fitness in the last X seconds.
Fitness is the couple (distance traveled) - (time to achieve this distance)

Cars are using Unity physics (rigidbody & wheel joint).
Cars are simplistic : a body (rectangle) and two wheel (circles).
